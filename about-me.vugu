<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> Introductions are hard. I am dio, a PoC <strong>software</strong> maker and <strong>enby</strong> (planning to write a whole thing about that soon that no one will read).
I live in a small canadian town and work remote.
Looking to contribute to <strong>#FOSS</strong> and learn more about <strong>#3dprinting</strong> and <strong>#datascience</strong>.
I also love posting about any philosophy papers. I am post-anarchist adjacent politically 🏴. If you know what that means (because I don't), that's awesome.
I am sure you and the dozens of other similarly politically inclined would be happy for me to tag along in one of your reading groups.
</p>
<p>Enjoy my anxiety posting, bye 👋.</p>

              <p> Wasmdude is an application made to show off.üßê
                  This site and all its flaws are my complete and total ability. üôÑ/s</p>
              <p> Okay, now to be more serious about this, this site takes most of my writing and projects from Github, Discord, etc. and
              tries to put them in one place that I can display it all.
              I decided that I would finally create a site no matter how shitty it actually ends up being and this is the result of that work in a a weekend.
              Continue at your own peril.</p>
              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p> Introductions are hard. I am dio, a PoC <strong>software</strong> maker and <strong>enby</strong>(planning to write a whole thing about that soon that no one will read).
                I live in a small canadian town and work remote.
                Looking to contribute to <strong>#FOSS</strong> and learn more about <strong>#3dprinting</strong> and <strong>#datascience</strong>.
                I also love posting about any philosophy papers. I am post-anarchist adjacent politically üè¥. If you know what that means (because I don't), that's awesome.
                I am sure you and the dozens of other similarly politically inclined would be happy for me to tag along in one of your reading groups.
            </p>
            <p>Enjoy my anxiety posting, bye üëã.</p>
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p> I have a few projects that I am working on. I will try to keep this list updated as I work on them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <a href="https://github.com/Diogenesoftoronto/wasmdude">wasmdude</a> - This site. I am using Vugo, Caddy and Encore to make this site. That's right, Full-stack Go development. üòé</li>
                <li> <a href="https://github.com/Diogenesoftoronto/tichu" >tichu</a> - Tichu is a multiplayer card game on the Command Line written in Go. I am using <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea">bubbletea</a> to create a TUI interface.
                    The rest is normal Go code, but I have a pretty neat build system and some more plans.</li>
                    <li> <a href="https://github.com/Diogenesoftoronto/write-and-wood">write-and-wood</a> - This project was created to make it easier to improve as a creative writer. Making writing collaborative and competitive is the goal.
